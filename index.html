            Despite involving the Waste Invaders game in "some" capacity, I consider this

            go ahead and publish the game's soundtrack was decided, postmortem, by my friend, 
            the game's original composer, with the album cover art being made on request.

                  "The Melt" was 3 minute short animated film that I produced
                  for my ethics class while attending CEGEP de Sept-Îles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The core theme of the film revolved around the disasterous
                  concequences of climate change presented throught a humourous
                  scope, featuring a wealthy polar bear lose his property over
                  time due to the melting of the polar ice caps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Software used to create the film were Adobe Photoshop, Adobe

                  "Train to Nowhere" is an unfinished video game, created during

                <p>
                  Concieved as a fusion between a puzzle game and a visual novel,
                  neither of those elements had time to make it into the project's
                  final build.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This project was my first time ever participating in a game jam. 
                  Needless to say, it was quite the learning experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game was developed using Godot engine, and the assets I 
                  created were made both in Microsoft Paint, and Adobe Photoshop.

                  "Waste invaders" was an educational video game I produced in
                  collaboration with a student from the Student Sustainability
                  Ambassadors Program from Concordia University, along with
                  other team members, including one of my friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The video game was a clone of the arcade game "Space Invaders" with
                  the main difference being there being 8 projectiles the player
                  to shoot, each of which could only take down a certain type of
                  enemy, that in of itself corresponded to 8 different types of
                  recycling categories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal of the project was to teach players the differences
                  between different categories of recyclable materials. After the
                  initial build was finished, it was then uploaded into an arcade
                  cabinet, built by the team and hand-painted by another artist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was the project's 2D artist and used Microsoft Paint and
                  Adobe Photoshop to create the game's art assets and concept
                  art, with Unity being the engine used to build the game.

                  "Mildew" is an upcoming video game project I have been working
                  on along with one of my friends since the fall of 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project was originally created during the game jam GBJam
                  10, with my friend and I expanding upon the project much later
                  on, and currently, to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The video game itself is a puzzle platformer featuring a
                  sentient puff of mildew wandering around a park clearing it of
                  its mold. The player is able to jump into differnt plant pots
                  and take control of them, using the plant's special abilities
                  to solve puzzles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was the artist and level designer for this project.
                  Microsoft Paint and Adobe Photoshop were used to create the
                  game's art assets and concept art, and the game ran on the
                  Unity engine.

                  "Quantum Cat-astrophe" is a puzzle platformer originally made
                  for CGDjam back in October of 2022, and was later expanded
                  upon for the following month.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game centers around a cat exploring a seemingly abandoned
                  underground laboratory searching for one of their friends- who
                  is a dog. The player would need to kill themselves using traps
                  placed throughout the level in order to become a ghost and
                  solve certain puzzles the cat cannot while still alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was the game's artist and also touched up some of the level
                  desgin as well. I used Microsoft Paint and Adobe Photohop in
                  order to create the game's art assets.

                  "Run for the Sun" is a video game that was originally concieved during 
                  Global Game Jam 2023. Unfortunately, due to technical issues during 
                  development, the game never got finished in time, and the orignal build 
                  was unable to be submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However! Despite that hiccup, myself and two other programmers on our team
                  decided to continue on with developing the game, eventually releasing it in
                  July 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As for the game itself, "Run for the Sun" is about "Sunny" a sunflower seed
                  who mysteriously gains a conciousness. From there, the player, using their mouse
                  controls Sunny by shooting their roots out around the level, to eventually 
                  climb all the way to the top, as fast as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My role in this project was originally solely as an aritst, however as 
                  development progressed I began to take on the role of level designer, 
                  and did a small bit of programming as well. This project was made in Unity,
                 and I made the game's art with Microsoft Paint and Adobe Photohop.

                  "Debbee's in Danger!" is a co-op video game made during CGDjam 2023.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this title, players take upon the role of beekeepers, who are 
                  tirelessly defending a nymph "Debbee" from wave upon wave of vicious 
                  hornets, all out to get her. The game has cooperative play as one of
                  its biggest features, where players have to work together to keep
                  Debbee safe as long as possible
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the time of updating this portfolio, the only build publically
                  available is the orginal one published for the game jam. However, some
                  developments have been made on the game post-jam, so an updated version
                  is definitely in the works...
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game was created in the Unity Engine, and I used solely Adobe Photoshop
                   to create all of the game's art and animations.

                  "Divine Affaire", originally "Chroniquer", is a research project based 
                  around a massive simulation, featuring simulated people interacting 
                  with each other and living about their lives. The project has a heavy focus 
                  on emergent narrtives, and getting users to interact with those narratives.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The simulation runs in the Unity Engine, and while the simulation itself is
                  complete for the time being, the focus of the research project now is to
                  create a game over-top of it, to act as a front-end to get
                  users to interact and discover the emergent narratives that the simulation
                  creates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I was brought onto the project in the summer of 2023, however, the project
                  has been going on for a few years before that.

                <p>
                  On this project, I've made a number of art assets, however only 
                  a few are present in the currently public build, with 99% of them being
                  for a feature planned to be implemented in the coming months.

                  The game is a platformer where the player plays as a clown participating in

                  challenges that they have to complete within a limited time frame. When time runs 
                  out, the player loses.

                  "FROGDROMEDA" is a arcade-style space shooter video game orignally created 
                  for one of my university classes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this game, players take control of a frog (in a frog-shaped spaceship) in space, 
                  who's tasked with destroying evil space bugs. Unlike other space shooters where 
                  players use bullets to deal with enemies, in FROGDROMEDA, players use their tongue 
                  to grab enemies, where they can shoot them back out afterward. The player also has 
                  access to an "inventory" where they can hold multiple enemies in their mouth at a time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game was exhibited at the DCART end of year exhibition held at Concordia University. 
                  The game was played using a joystick controller with a mouse, however the current build 
                  can be played using keyboard controls, as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I still have plans to continue working on this game in the future, but there's no real 
                  timeframe I can give at this moment where I can say the "finished" version of the game 
                  will be released.
                </p>
                <p>
                  FROGDROMEDA was developed using the Unity game engine, and for the art assets I used Microsoft

                  "Reverie Recipies" is a co-op video game created during the Ubisoft GameLab 2024 competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game's plot revolves around a chef, on his deathbed, passing onto his son his restaurant. 
                  The catch? His son doesn't know how to cook. From there, the son returns home and goes to bed, 
                  only to see his father in his dream, and from there, learns how to cook.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game can be best described as a 3D hack 'n slash, where players need to kill and collect 
                  evil sentient ingredients to cook up a food dish, which manifests as a boss which players also 
                  have to defeat as well. Each player is rewarded with a new weapon upon completing each round. So 
                  far, there are only two rounds, but there have been talks to continue developing the game further 
                  and adding additional levels. However, at the time of writing this, I haven't recieved any updates 
                  from my peers regarding continuing the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The game was made using the Unity game engine, and the art assets that I created (those being some 
                  of the enemies and the latter portion of the opening cutscene) were created using Blender and 
                  Blockbench for the 3D models, and Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Premiere for the cutscene art.

                  In it, players play as a flea bouncing on a set of blocks which are both endlessly shifting

                </p>
                <p>
                  FLEAS! was orignially created for a University course, and I continued developing the game 
                  after the course had wrapped up. I plan to continue developing the game further, as there are
